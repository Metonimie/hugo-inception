        It all began with a few years of plastic arts. Only after that, have I discovered numbers and mathematical 
        concepts, electronics and information technology.

        The passion for computer technology has grown exponentially during the study hours at Politehnica University 
        Timi»ôoara (UPT) when I first discovered reconfigurable hardware and hardware description languages. Since then, 
        I have tried to combine both plastic arts and technology, focusing on the analysis and development of related 
        FPGA-oriented architectures - as both my Bachelor and Master theses are.

        I am currently a PhD candidate at the Department of Computers and Information Technology, UPT, with the goal of 
        analyzing the multi-fractal properties of biological signals, and developing hardware acceleration architectures 
        for health condition prediction.
