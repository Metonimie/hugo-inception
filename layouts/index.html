            <p><b>Short summary:</b> Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third major cause of death and
                a
                serious
                impediment for the quality of living; it is defined as a clinical condition that consists of airways
                obstruction which reduces pulmonary capacity. The causes which trigger COPD are not clarified, but
                scientists converge on indicating smoking and exposure to pollution as main factors. COPD is not
                reversible,
                however early detection leads to a better disease evolution.
                Although COPD diagnosis is a complex process, it is mostly based on spirometry which is performed in a
                controlled medical environment. The spirometer is a device that measures the air capacity of lungs,
                rendered
                as parameters FEV1 and FVC; these parameters are used to classify patients is one of the COPD stages:
                I-Mild, II-Moderate, III-Severe, and IV-Very Severe. The unanimously accepted classification methodology
                is
                the COPD Gold Standard. Unfortunately, early COPD detection and diagnosis at population-level is
                difficult
                because clinical signs are hard to detect in early phases. As such, patients are subjected to spirometry
                and
                diagnosed when they are already at stages II-IV, thus smoothing the disease trajectory by therapy
                becomes
                difficult.</p>
            <p>In order to address the problem of COPD management in a big population of individuals, we propose a
                personalized (precision) medicine approach that relies on big data gathering and modeling, according to
                the
                complex network paradigm. Our scope is to demonstrate a solution that consists of a mobile and cloud
                computing integrated system for COPD early detection, monitoring, and management. Therefore, our system
                aims
                at detecting COPD cases in phases I and II. Nonetheless, such a result is not a conventional diagnosis,
                therefore the prediction will have to be checked and confirmed by a physician. We also intend to provide
                a
                disease monitoring and management solution for individuals that are already diagnosed with COPD, in
                order to
                assess the effectiveness of their therapy and provide feedback to medical doctors and clinical trial
                companies.</p>
